# Polygon.css

A simple SCSS boilerplate.

## What?

A simple CSS boilerplate written in SASS (SCSS syntax) and a Gruntfile to make it easy to start non-bloated web projects.

It focus on provinding some basic styling, some helpers, a good architeture and a set of basic rules for your CSS. It was built to make it yours. It's not made to be extended but to be modified for the project as it's just a boilerplate and **not a framework**.

## Why?

There are lots of frameworks out there, some are minimal and some are full sets with UI and styling included, and most of them are great and can bring great value but **none of them was what I needed**. They usually are bloated, with rigid structure and have a big learning curve. All I needed was normalize.css, a small set of Styles pre-defined and a simple grid that just works. Well, here we are ;D

To the day I have used it in every web page/app I do and the results are great. The CSS and HTML complexity has lowered a lot, compared to the previous Frameworks I used, and the final CSS file is around 30kb heavy in average, even in larger web sites :D.

    It has more than 4 years of proven and tested features. It's pretty safe to use it!

## How?

It's pretty straight forward. Change the variables as you need, choose your classes names and just write your CSS. You shouldn't use grunt now, it's going to be removed soon but it's still a valid way to use Polygon.css as it will compile the SCSS files, add the prefixes, add the REM fallback and minify your CSS.
